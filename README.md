## 🏗 Project Architecture

Rooky follows a modular frontend architecture within each app directory. The main source code resides in the `src/` folder, which is organized as follows:

- `src/` – Main application source code.
- `components/` – Reusable UI components (buttons, forms, widgets, etc.).
- `contexts/` – Application-wide state management and shared logic.
- `pages/` – Top-level views and route handlers for the app.
- `Cargo.toml` – App-specific dependencies and metadata.
- `manifest.json` – Web app manifest for PWA support.
- `serviceWorker.js` – Enables offline functionality.
- `Trunk.toml` – Build configuration for Trunk.
- `build.rs` – Optional custom build scripts.

There is no centralized backend. All communication occurs via **Nostr** relays, and local data is stored in **IndexedDB**, ensuring a fully decentralized architecture.

## 🌐 How Rooky Uses Nostr

Fuente leverages **Nostr** as its primary communication protocol for a trustless and decentralized experience. 

### 🔗 Communication with Relays
- All messages, transactions, and interactions are sent via **Nostr relays**, removing the need for centralized servers.
- Each app (consumer, business, admin, etc.) subscribes to specific events in the network, ensuring seamless interaction.

### 🔑 Authentication
- Users authenticate using **Nostr public/private keys** instead of traditional logins.
- Private keys are securely stored on the client-side, never exposing them to third parties.

### 📦 Data Storage
- No centralized database is used. Instead, **IndexedDB** is leveraged for local storage.
- Users retain control over their data, which can be synchronized across devices via Nostr relays.

Using **Nostr** ensures Rooky remains **censorship-resistant**, **fault-tolerant**, and **decentralized**, making it an ideal solution for borderless commerce.
